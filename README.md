## How the project works?
- This project is basically a script that checks whether an object is a valid "JSON" object or not.
- There are group of steps (folders) that contain a set of valid and invalid objects, and the script will tell you which one is valid.

## How to run the project
- Follow these steps:
  - Clone the project
  - npm install
  - npm start

- You can choose which step you want to test by uncommenting it in "index.js" file.
